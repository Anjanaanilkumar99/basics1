OPERATORS IN C

Operators
An operator is a symbol that is used to perform task.

Type of operators 

      •	Arithmetic operators
      •	Logical operators
      •	Relational operators
      •	Shift operators
      •	Assignment operators
      •	Bitwise operators
      •	Conditional operators

1) Arithmetic operators

      An arithmetic operator performs mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,increment,decrement,modulous.
 
+ Used to add values
    Eg: A +B
- Subtracts one value from another
    Eg: A – B
* Multiplies two values	
    Eg: A * B
/ Divides one value by another	
    Eg: A / B
% Returns the division remainder	
    Eg: A % B
++ Increases the value of a variable by 1	
    Eg: ++A
-- Decreases the value of a variable by 1	
    Eg: --A

2) Logical operators

Logical  operators are used to determine the logic between variable and value.

Logical operators are logical and, logical or, logical not.

&& Logical and	returns true if both statements are true

   Eg: X < 5 && X < 10

|| Logical or	returns true if one of the statements is true	
   
   Eg:x < 5 || x < 4

! Logical not	reverse the result, returns false if the result is true

   Eg:!(x < 5 && x < 10)	


3)Relational operators

The relational operators  check relationship between two operands.
The relation happens to be true, then it returns  1. But in case this relation turns out to be false, then it returns 0.

== Equal to
 
  Eg: A == B

!= Not equal 
  
  Eg:A != B

> Greater than
  Eg: A > G

< Less than
  Eg: A < B

>= Greater than or equal to
  Eg: A >= B

<= Less than or equal to
  Eg: A <= B


4)Conditional operators

The conditional operator is also known as a ternary operator.A conditional operator works on three operands.
A conditional statements are the decision making statements which depends  up on the output of the expression.

syntax:
      Expression1? expression2: expression3;  
  

    .Expression1 is a boolean condition that can be either true or false
    .If the expression1 results into a true value, then the expression2 will execute.     
    .The expression2 is said to be true only when it returns a non-zero value.
    .If the expression1 returns false value then the expression3 will execute.
    .The expression3 is said to be false only when it returns zero value.

5)Assignment operator
   
An assignment operation assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the storage location named by the left-hand operand.
  

=    x =5             x = 5	assign 5 to the variable x
+=   X += 3           X =X+3    plus and assign operator
-=   X -= 3           X =X-3    subtract and assign operator
*=   x *= 3	      X =X*3    multiple and assign operator
/=   X /= 3           X =X/3    divide and assign operator
%=   X %= 3	      X =X%3	modulus and assign operator


6)Bitwise operators
     Used to perform data at bit level

Bitwise AND

eg:a=6  b=4
   a = 0110  b = 0100  
    a&b=0100

Bitwise OR

eg: a=23 b=10
   a = 0001 0111  
   b = 0000 1010  
   a|b = 0001 1111  


Bitwise compliment

eg:a=8
   a=1000
   result=0111
   

7)Shift operators

It used to shift binary bits either in the left direction or in the right direction

    Left shift operator
 
syntax:

var_name << no_of_position  

   Right shift operator

syntax:
  
var_name >> no_of_position
